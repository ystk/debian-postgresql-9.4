>      Check for serializability conflicts before reporting
      constraint-violation failures (Thomas Munro)
     </P
><P
>      When using serializable transaction isolation, it is desirable
      that any error due to concurrent transactions should manifest
      as a serialization failure, thereby cueing the application that
      a retry might succeed.  Unfortunately, this does not reliably
      happen for duplicate-key failures caused by concurrent insertions.
      This change ensures that such an error will be reported as a
      serialization error if the application explicitly checked for
      the presence of a conflicting key (and did not find it) earlier
      in the transaction.

     </P
><P
>      This fixes problems occurring when the first value in a column has a
      determinable typmod (e.g., length for a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>varchar</TT
> value) but
      later values don't share the same limit.

>      Normally, a Unicode surrogate leading character must be followed by a
      Unicode surrogate trailing character, but the check for this was
      missed if the leading character was the last character in a Unicode
      string literal (<TT
