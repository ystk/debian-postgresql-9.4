      link to some other file, which would then become corrupted by appending
      log messages.

>      By default, these scripts are not installed anywhere.  Users who have
      made use of them will need to manually recopy them, or apply the same
      changes to their modified versions.  If the
      existing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$PGLOG</TT
> file is root-owned, it will need to
      be removed or renamed out of the way before restarting the server with
      the corrected script.

      This patch does not do anything to protect existing views/rules,
      only ones created in the future.

      for use in hash joins or hash aggregation, but actually it must check
      whether the range's subtype has hash support.  This does not affect any
      of the built-in range types, since they're all hashable anyway.
