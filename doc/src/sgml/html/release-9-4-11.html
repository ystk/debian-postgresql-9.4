><P
>      Check for serializability conflicts before reporting
      constraint-violation failures (Thomas Munro)
     </P
><P
>      When using serializable transaction isolation, it is desirable
      that any error due to concurrent transactions should manifest
      as a serialization failure, thereby cueing the application that
      a retry might succeed.  Unfortunately, this does not reliably
      happen for duplicate-key failures caused by concurrent insertions.
      This change ensures that such an error will be reported as a
      serialization error if the application explicitly checked for
      the presence of a conflicting key (and did not find it) earlier
      in the transaction.

      Unicode surrogate trailing character, but the check for this was
      missed if the leading character was the last character in a Unicode
