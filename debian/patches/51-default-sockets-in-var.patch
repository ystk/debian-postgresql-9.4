Description: Put server Unix sockets into /var/run/postgresql/ by default
Forwarded: No, Debian specific configuration with postgresql-common

Using /tmp for sockets allows everyone to spoof a PostgreSQL server. Thus use
/var/run/postgresql/ for "system" clusters which run as 'postgres' (user
clusters will still use /tmp). Since system cluster are by far the common case,
set it as default.
